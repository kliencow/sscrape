# sscrape is a simple web page scraper

(untested)

This app likely doesn't do anything yet. It's meant to help with some simple webscraping that I needed. In general, it's not meant to help with finding information in webpages as much as it's meant to just download pages and data. My hope is to add various means of authentication handling in here so it's easy to set up whether it's basic auth, digest, OAuth, or even a lazy cookie based un/pw session page.

## Features (so far)
* Basic cookie handling!
* Basic GET/POST requests
* POST based form logins
* that's it
